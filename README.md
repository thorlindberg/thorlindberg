Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thor Lindberg, a 25-year old developer and digital designer working in IT administration and data analytics.

I have 4+ years of experience with object-oriented programming (OOP) languages, and 1+ year of experience with event/state-driven software development.

My interests include software design, data processing, augmented reality, and machine learning. I express these through my work and projects as an independent Apple developer.

Through my degrees in information science and technology I have developed skills in planning and conducting iterative, agile, and cross-disciplinary IT projects.
